# Quantum key distribution project
Copyright Marc Scattolin and Raphael Pinsonneault-Thibeault, 2020

External dependancies: Python 3.6+ and Qiskit (in Python).

This is a netbeans project but can be compiled with gradle, run the distZip task. Note, however, that
after compilation, the .py files need to be moved into the generated bin folder.
Also note that this project can currently only run in Windows, because of the command used to 
create a Python Process.
